DEMO
Architecture
	Completed, remaining
	Modularity
	Queue server
	Callbacks
	Hands off, least commitment approach (tempting, styles, queries)

What we're NOT
	Machine learning system that auto generates report queries
	We provide a nice system to offload report generation and interfacing
	System responsible for generating the actual query and providing access to report request

Features
	UI mockup
	Example, UI, and queue
	JSON API
	Login, configure
		Secured, custom current_user method fetcher
		Highly customizable due to architecture
		RESTful way
		Loosely coupled interface for creating new report to generation
	Separation of responsibilities
	Queue technologies/production power

Future
	Notifications layer
	Template config backend
	Database connection
	Sample CRON jobs
	Sample templates
